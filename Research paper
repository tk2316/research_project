Determinants of Coup d'etat

When we think about the transition or transfer of power in democratic countries, we assume that the legitimacy of authority is handed over 
peacefully through electoral and civil process to a new leadership. Violent overthrow or forceful mobilization of government seems like a rare 
event that occured mostly in the past. However, coup d'etat - " stroke of state" or "blow of state" - takes place much more frequently around the world
than people expects. Coup d'etat is a man made phenomenon and it can be dissected inorder to see what causes such an event. In this research, three potential determinants 
that may play a role in increasing the likelihood of coup d'etat occuring have been established as Economic, geo-political, and social facotrs.
