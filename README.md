## **Purpose of the research**
In the 21st century, two most popular forms of government around the world are direct democracy and representative democracy. In these two systems, the head of the state is elected and after a certain duration of service, election is held again and the leader is replaced by a new official. This smooth transition of power seems to be the norm nowadays but like any events there are anomalies. Coup d'etat or overthrow, is an illegal seizure of power or removal of a government and its powers by a political faction, politician, cult, rebel group, military, or a dictator. Studying anomalies give us just as many insights (if not more) as studying the norms of a certain phenomenon. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the underlying factors that make the occurence of coup d'etat more likely.
Some of the underlying factors include...
- Economic: GDP, unemployment rate, inflation, Currency Srength and stability, GDP per capita, PPP, CPI.
- Social: Ethnic, linguistic, Religious diversity
- Political: Approval rating, Fragile States Index, and Freedom Score.
